# Firm-segmentation
(Python: scipy, sklearn, ppca, pandas, numpy, and matplotlib) Use unsupervised learning methods to group firms based on patterns across 64 financial figures. Dataset includes firms facing imminent bankruptcy. Pre-process the data, create a t-SNE plot, perform dimensionality reduction using probabilistic PCA, and run a hierarchical clustering algorithm. Led to two clusters, where 94% of the members in the second cluster were facing imminent bankruptcy.
